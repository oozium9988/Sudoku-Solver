# Sudoku-Solver

Sudoku solver which highlights cases where possible solutions are eliminated via naked and hidden subsets that contain more than 1 number. For more difficult sudokus, it will also show cases where one number has to be randomly selected from a cell with only two possible solutions. In each case, the previous state of the sudoku will be printed and the sudoku will be printed again showing the changes made.

Final solution will be printed at the bottom of the output.
